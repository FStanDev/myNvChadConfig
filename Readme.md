# My Nvim configuration

Initialy this was my [nvchad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) configuration, but on v2.5 there were some changes that break my configuration and piss me off so I decided to make my own nvim configuration, to be as simple as possible for my needs, and leave it plublic if anyone wants to replicate it.

I don´t believe the v2.5 change was wrong, it was just a change and I´m still very grateful to Siduck for the amazing tool he made, and some configs are direct copies from their repo, like NvimTree configuration.

I´ll add more configuration as I need it.

## Config Structure

### Base
On base folder you will find the core configuration of nvim, like lazy installation and basic remappings.

### Configs
On configs folder you will find specific configuraton for each plugin of my setup.

```git clone https://github.com/FStanDev/myNvChadConfig.git ~/.config/nvim && nvim```
